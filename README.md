simple image gallery screensaver for mac
made with quartz composer

the screensaver;
1. loads a folder of images (by default the current user's /Pictures folder)
2. uses a random number generator to select two images
3. resizes the images if they are over a certain size (more than 100% the window height for the first image, more than 120% for the second image)
4. positions the first image in the bottom right of the window, the second image in the centre left
5. replaces each image at alternate intervals with a new random image (by default after 3 seconds)
